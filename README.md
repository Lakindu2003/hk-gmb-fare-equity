### 1. Introduction
#### 1.1. Background
Hong Kong’s public transportation system is one of the most efficient and widely used in the world, transporting around 11.7 million passengers daily (Transport Department, 2025c). This system mainly consists of the Mass Transit Railway (MTR), bus, and Green MiniBus (GMB). Given this daily reliance, the affordability of their fares is of significant public interest. In recent years, according to various news articles, there has been growing discontent across different districts regarding the fairness of these prices. For example, according to a lawmaker, Tien, the East Rail Line is about 30% cheaper than the West Rail Line while having lower travel times. This disparity has drawn public criticism (Yè, 2022). While this issue of fare equity is system-wide, the GMB's critical role in connecting underserved communities (Transport Department, 2017, pp. 43–44) makes it a logical starting point for analysis. 
#### 1.2. Problem statement
While these criticisms highlight the existence of a fundamental gap, the absence of an objective methodology makes these claims purely anecdotal. Focusing on GMB, the central problem can be broken down into two sub-problems: firstly, modeling the fares for GMB routes across different districts in Hong Kong, and secondly, determining any districts with unreasonably expensive GMB prices.
#### 1.3. Project Significance
The significance of this project lies in its capacity to bridge the gap between subjective public perception and objective reality. The systematic modeling of fares and classification of unfairly priced districts provides tangible evidence against GMB fare inequity. This contributes towards shaping future government policy, thereby resulting in improved standards of living.



#### 1.4. Objectives
To assess the equity of GMB fares, this project accomplished the following objectives:
Develop a robust and interpretable regression statistical model for GMB fares.
Identify districts with unreasonably expensive GMB fares by interpreting the model’s coefficients.
#### 1.5. Deliverables
This project delivered a GitHub repository, which contained a Jupyter notebook. This notebook presented the data processing, EDA, model training, and model evaluation pipelines for the final model.
#### 1.6. Outline
This report is organized into five main sections. Section 2 highlights the methodology detailing the project setup, data collection, data processing, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and modeling pipelines. Section 3 presents the modeling results and the interpretations of the final model. Section 4 provides a discussion of these results, interpreting their real-world implications while highlighting the project limitations. Finally, section 5 provides a concluding summary of the project’s findings and potential future work.
